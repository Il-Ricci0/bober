# 🦫 Bober

**“Dam problem detected, Bober is on it.”**  

Bober is a software that:  
- 🪚 Chews through server errors  
- 🪵 Stacks logs like a proper beaver  
- 🏗️ Builds dams to stop downtime floods  
- 📄 Drafts blueprints (incident reports) for every fix  

Because building a dam is good, but remembering how to build it is **even better**. 💪
